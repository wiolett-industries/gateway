  discovery: `# Resource Discovery

Gateway AI starts conversations with a small base tool surface. Domain-specific tools are discovered by category and then remembered on the backend conversation.

## Base Tools
- discover_tools: inspect callable tool categories and category-specific tools.
- get_current_context: read the current UI route/resource when the user says "this page" or "current item".
- wait: pause briefly when an operation is pending, then continue by re-checking status.
- find_resource: globally search readable resources by name, ID, domain, image, etc.
- internal_documentation: read workflow and argument docs before complex operations.
- ask_question: ask concise clarifying questions.
- fetch: read a direct HTTP/HTTPS URL through Gateway when sandbox runner is enabled and the user has sandbox access.
- web_search: available only when enabled by settings.

## Tool Discovery
- If the needed operation is not available, call discover_tools first.
- Use internal_documentation before Gateway-specific workflows, tool argument details, permission-sensitive operations, and recently added capabilities. Do not answer those from general intuition.
- Use discover_tools({ category: "Logging" }) before managing logging environments/schemas/logs.
- Use discover_tools({ category: "Docker" }) before managing Docker containers/images/volumes/networks.
- Use discover_tools({ query: "certificate" }) when you know the task but not the category.
- After discovery, use internal_documentation for workflow details and argument shapes.

Use find_resource whenever the user gives a name, domain, hostname, image, container name, certificate name, logging environment/schema name, database name, or other visible identifier and you need the actual ID or nodeId.
Use find_resource with an empty query and a concrete type when the user asks to list resources by type, for example Docker containers.

## Rule
- Use get_current_context when the user refers to the page or resource they are currently viewing.
- Use wait for short pending states such as container startup, image pull completion, DNS/SSL validation, deployments, daemon reloads, or log ingestion. After wait, call the relevant read/status tool again; do not finish the conversation just because the operation is not complete yet.
- Prefer find_resource before broad list sweeps.
- For a direct URL, use fetch. Use web_search only when you need search results rather than the exact URL content.
- Do not list every node and then inspect every node for Docker resources unless find_resource failed, the user explicitly asked for per-node enumeration, or you need a complete inventory.
- If the result includes nodeId, pass that nodeId to Docker tools.
- If exactly one result is valid/applicable for the operation, use it without asking. For Docker image/container operations, ignore non-Docker nodes as choices.
- If multiple applicable results match, use ask_question to disambiguate.

## Examples
- Find a container named api: find_resource({ query: "api", types: ["docker_container"] })
- List Docker containers: find_resource({ query: "", types: ["docker_container"], limit: 50 })
- List Docker nodes: find_resource({ query: "", types: ["node"], limit: 50 })
- Find a proxy host by domain: find_resource({ query: "example.com", types: ["proxy_host"] })
- Find a logging schema: find_resource({ query: "nginx", types: ["logging_schema"] })
- Search all readable resources: find_resource({ query: "production" })`,

  pki: `# PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

## Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- **Root CA**: Self-signed, top of the trust chain. Created with create_root_ca. Set pathLengthConstraint to limit CA chain depth (0 = can only issue end-entity certs, 1 = can create one level of intermediate CAs).
- **Intermediate CA**: Signed by a parent CA. Created with create_intermediate_ca(parentCaId, ...). Recommended for issuing end-entity certificates.
- Key algorithms: rsa-2048, rsa-4096, ecdsa-p256, ecdsa-p384.
- CAs can be revoked (permanent) or deleted (only if no certs issued).
- Each CA has: commonName, keyAlgorithm, validityYears, maxValidityDays (max validity for certs it issues).

## PKI Certificates
- Issued by a CA using issue_certificate.
- Types: tls-server (web/SSL), tls-client (client auth), code-signing, email (S/MIME).
- Fields: caId, commonName, keyAlgorithm, validityDays, type, sans (Subject Alternative Names).
- SANs: array of PLAIN strings — just the value, NO type prefix. Examples: "example.com", "*.example.com", "10.0.0.1", "user@example.com". The system auto-detects the type (dns/ip/email/url). NEVER use "DNS:", "IP:", or other prefixes — they will cause errors.
- Certificates can be revoked with a reason (key_compromise, superseded, unspecified, etc.).
- Private keys are generated server-side and encrypted at rest.

## PKI → SSL Workflow
PKI certificates live in a separate store from SSL certificates. To use a PKI cert with a proxy host:
1. issue_certificate → returns { certificate, message }
2. link_internal_cert(internalCertId: certificate.id) → creates an SSL certificate entry
3. Use the SSL certificate ID (from step 2) when creating/updating proxy hosts.
NEVER use a PKI certificate ID directly as sslCertificateId on a proxy host.`,

  ssl: `# SSL Certificates

SSL certificates in Gateway are used to enable HTTPS on proxy hosts. Three types exist:

## Types
1. **ACME** (Let's Encrypt): Automated free certificates via request_acme_cert. Requires domain verification. Auto-renewable.
2. **Upload**: Manually uploaded PEM certificate + private key via manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "upload", ... }). No auto-renewal — must be re-uploaded before expiry.
3. **Internal**: Linked from PKI store via link_internal_cert(internalCertId). Uses the PKI cert's key material. Renewed by re-issuing the PKI cert and re-linking.

## ACME Certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- request_acme_cert({ domains: ["example.com", "www.example.com"], challengeType: "http-01" })
- **http-01**: Gateway automatically serves the challenge at /.well-known/acme-challenge/ on port 80. The daemon deploys challenge files to nginx. Port 80 must be publicly accessible.
- **dns-01 with Cloudflare**: For wildcard certs or when port 80 is blocked and a matching Cloudflare connector/zone is configured. Use request_acme_cert({ domains, challengeType: "dns-01", dnsProvider: "cloudflare" }). Gateway creates the TXT records, waits for propagation, verifies the ACME order, cleans up created TXT records, and returns the issued certificate.
- **manual dns-01**: If no Cloudflare connector/zone is available, omit dnsProvider. The tool returns { domain, recordName, recordValue }; user must create a DNS TXT record manually, then confirm with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "verify_dns", sslCertificateId }).
- Auto-renew: checked daily at 3 AM. Renews certificates 30 days before expiry.
- DNS-01 auto-renew requires Cloudflare. Enable or disable it with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "set_auto_renew", sslCertificateId, enabled: true, provider: "cloudflare" }) or enabled: false.
- Staging mode available for testing (certs not browser-trusted).

## Uploading Custom Certificates
- manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "upload", certificatePem, privateKeyPem, chainPem? })
- Chain PEM is optional (intermediate CA chain).
- Expiry is parsed from the certificate — no auto-renewal.

## Using PKI Certificates as SSL
To use a PKI-issued certificate with a proxy host:
1. Issue a PKI certificate: issue_certificate(...) → returns cert with id
2. Link it: link_internal_cert(internalCertId: cert.id) → creates an SSL certificate entry with a separate ID
3. Use the SSL certificate ID (from step 2) as sslCertificateId on the proxy host
IMPORTANT: Never use a PKI certificate ID directly as sslCertificateId — you must link it first.

## Using SSL Certs with Proxy Hosts
- Set sslCertificateId on the proxy host to the SSL certificate UUID.
- Set sslEnabled: true to enable HTTPS.
- sslForced: true redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS (301 redirect).
- http2Support: true enables HTTP/2 (recommended with SSL).

## Certificate Deployment
When an SSL cert is assigned to a proxy host, Gateway:
1. Pushes the cert/key files to the nginx daemon node
2. Updates the nginx config to reference the cert files
3. Tests the config (nginx -t)
4. Reloads nginx to apply`,

  proxy: `# Reverse Proxy Hosts

## Types
- **proxy**: Forward requests to a backend server (forwardHost:forwardPort).
- **redirect**: Redirect to a URL (redirectUrl, redirectStatusCode: 301/302).
- **404**: Return 404 for all requests (used to block domains).

## Key Fields
- nodeId: the daemon node this host is deployed on (required when creating).
- domainNames: array of domains this host serves.
- forwardHost/forwardPort/forwardScheme: backend server details (for proxy type).
- sslEnabled: enable HTTPS. Requires sslCertificateId (SSL cert UUID, NOT PKI cert UUID).
- sslForced: redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- http2Support: enable HTTP/2.
- websocketSupport: enable WebSocket proxying.
- accessListId: attach an access list for IP/auth restrictions.
- healthCheckEnabled: monitor backend availability.
- advancedConfig: raw nginx config snippet (advanced users only).
- rawConfigEnabled: bypass template rendering and use rawConfig directly.
- rawConfig: custom nginx configuration content (used when rawConfigEnabled is true).
- enabled: toggle host on/off without deleting.
- folderId: organize into folders.
- nginxTemplateId: use a custom nginx template.

Ordinary list_proxy_hosts and get_proxy_host responses omit rawConfig and rawConfigEnabled. Raw content is only available through explicit raw config read/render tools with raw-read permission.

## Nginx Config
Each proxy host generates an nginx server block. Changes are applied by reloading nginx.
Config templates can customize the generated config (see templates topic).

## Raw Config Mode
When rawConfigEnabled is true, the template rendering is bypassed and rawConfig is used directly as the nginx server block. Use get_proxy_rendered_config to view the current config, toggle_proxy_raw_mode to enable/disable, and update_proxy_raw_config to write raw config.`,

  domains: `# Domains

Domains are Cloudflare-backed DNS records used across Gateway.

## Purpose
- Create and track Cloudflare A/AAAA records that point to configured Gateway public IPs
- Adopt existing matching Cloudflare A/AAAA records without changing their target
- Detect target mismatches before creating proxy hosts
- Required for ACME HTTP-01 challenges (domain must resolve to Gateway)

## Lifecycle
1. Register a domain: create_domain({ domain: "example.com" })
2. Gateway autodetects the matching Cloudflare zone and desired A/AAAA target IPs
3. If Cloudflare has no conflicting address records, Gateway creates DNS and stores the domain as valid
4. If Cloudflare already has matching A/AAAA records, Gateway adopts them as matched_existing
5. If Cloudflare has different A/AAAA records, create_domain returns conflict metadata; retry with overwriteDns only after explicit user approval
6. Use manage_domain({ operation: "check_dns", domainId }) to manually re-check resolved DNS

## DNS Records Tracked
- **A**: IPv4 address, created from Gateway Public IP(s)
- **AAAA**: IPv6 address, created from Gateway Public IP(s)
- Other record types are not created or overwritten by Gateway domain tools in v1

## Rules
- Domains used by proxy hosts cannot be deleted (remove from proxy first)
- isSystem domains (management domains) cannot be deleted
- Wildcard domains (*.example.com) can be registered
- delete_domain requires domains:delete. Cloudflare DNS records are deleted only when the caller also has integrations:cloudflare:dns:delete
- For matched_existing domains, pass deleteDns=false to keep DNS and remove only the Gateway mapping, or deleteDns=true to remove the adopted Cloudflare records`,

  'access-lists': `# Access Lists

Access lists provide IP-based access control and HTTP basic authentication for proxy hosts.

## How It Works
1. Create an access list with IP rules and/or basic auth users
2. Attach it to one or more proxy hosts via accessListId
3. Nginx enforces the rules on every request to those proxy hosts

## IP Rules
- Array of rules: { type: "allow"|"deny", value: "CIDR or IP" }
- Examples: { type: "allow", value: "10.0.0.0/8" }, { type: "deny", value: "0.0.0.0/0" }
- Rules are evaluated in order — first match wins
- Common pattern: allow specific IPs/ranges, deny all others

## Basic Authentication
- basicAuthEnabled: true to enable HTTP basic auth
- basicAuthUsers: array of { username, password }
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage in htpasswd format
- Htpasswd files are deployed to nginx nodes via daemon

## Tool Argument Shapes
- create_access_list accepts allowIps and denyIps as string arrays plus basicAuthUsers.
- manage_access_list({ operation: "update", accessListId, ... }) accepts ipRules as ordered { type, value } objects and basicAuthUsers as { username, password } objects.
- Use basicAuthEnabled to turn HTTP basic auth on or off. If it is enabled, provide at least one basic auth user.

## Usage
- One access list can be shared across multiple proxy hosts
- Changing an access list automatically updates all proxy hosts using it
- Deleting an access list detaches it from all hosts first`,

  templates: `# Certificate Templates

Templates define preset configurations for issuing PKI certificates. They save time and enforce consistency.

## How Templates Work
1. Admin creates a template with desired settings (cert type, key algorithm, validity, key usage, etc.)
2. When issuing a certificate, select the template — its settings become defaults
3. Settings can still be overridden per-certificate at issue time

## Template Fields
- **certType**: tls-server, tls-client, code-signing, email
- **keyAlgorithm**: rsa-2048, rsa-4096, ecdsa-p256, ecdsa-p384
- **validityDays**: default validity period (1-3650 days)
- **keyUsage**: digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, nonRepudiation
- **extKeyUsage**: serverAuth, clientAuth, codeSigning, emailProtection, timeStamping, ocspSigning (plus custom OIDs)
- **requireSans**: whether SANs are mandatory when issuing
- **sanTypes**: allowed SAN types (dns, ip, email, uri)
- **subjectDnFields**: default Organization, OU, Locality, State, Country for the certificate subject
- **crlDistributionPoints**: URLs for CRL download
- **authorityInfoAccess**: OCSP responder URL and CA Issuers URL
- **certificatePolicies**: policy OIDs with optional CPS qualifier URLs
- **customExtensions**: arbitrary X.509 extensions by OID (hex-encoded DER values)

## Built-in Templates
- isBuiltin: true — provided by default, cannot be edited or deleted
- Common presets: TLS Server, TLS Client, Code Signing, Email

## Nginx Config Templates
Separate from certificate templates — these define nginx server block templates for proxy hosts.
- Each template has a type: proxy, redirect, or 404.
- Templates use variable syntax ({{variableName}}) for dynamic values
- Can be cloned and customized
- Assigned to proxy hosts via nginxTemplateId`,

  acme: `# ACME (Automated Certificate Management)

Let's Encrypt integration for free, automated SSL certificates.

## Issuing an ACME Certificate
1. request_acme_cert({ domains: ["example.com", "www.example.com"], challengeType: "http-01" })
2. Gateway contacts Let's Encrypt, receives a challenge
3. For http-01: Gateway deploys challenge files to nginx nodes automatically, Let's Encrypt verifies
4. For Cloudflare dns-01: use request_acme_cert({ domains, challengeType: "dns-01", dnsProvider: "cloudflare" }); Gateway creates TXT records, verifies, cleans up, and can enable Cloudflare auto-renew.
5. For manual dns-01: Gateway returns { domain, recordName, recordValue } — user creates DNS TXT record, then confirms
6. Certificate is issued and stored as an SSL certificate

## Challenge Types
- **http-01** (recommended): Fully automatic. Gateway serves the challenge at \`/.well-known/acme-challenge/\` on port 80. Requires: port 80 publicly accessible, domain resolving to nginx node IP.
- **dns-01 with Cloudflare**: Automatic when a matching Cloudflare connector/zone is configured. Use dnsProvider: "cloudflare".
- **manual dns-01**: For wildcard certificates (*.example.com) or when port 80 is blocked. Manual step: add a TXT record at \`_acme-challenge.example.com\`. Supports wildcard issuance.

## Auto-Renewal
- Checked daily at 3 AM (configurable via ACME_RENEWAL_CRON setting)
- Renews certificates 30 days before expiry
- Uses the same challenge type as the original issuance
- DNS-01 auto-renew requires Cloudflare and is controlled with manage_ssl_certificate({ operation: "set_auto_renew", sslCertificateId, enabled, provider: "cloudflare" })
- Renewal failures are logged and alerted

## Staging Mode
- ACME_STAGING=true in settings uses Let's Encrypt staging servers
- Certificates are NOT trusted by browsers (for testing only)
- Useful for testing ACME flow without hitting rate limits
- Rate limits: 50 certs per registered domain per week (production)

## Troubleshooting
- **Challenge fails**: Verify domain resolves to your nginx node IP (check Domains page). Ensure port 80 is open and not blocked by firewall.
- **DNS-01 fails**: Verify TXT record is propagated (use dig or nslookup). TTL must be low enough for timely propagation.
- **Rate limited**: Switch to staging for testing. Production limit: 5 duplicate certs per week, 50 per domain per week.
- **Renewal fails**: Check daemon logs on the nginx node. Verify the node is online and connected.`,

  users: `# User Management

## Authentication
Users authenticate via OIDC (OpenID Connect). Gateway acts as a relying party — it does not store passwords.
- OIDC provider configured in Settings (issuer URL, client ID, client secret)
- First login auto-creates the user in the default permission group
- Subsequent logins update the user's name and avatar from the OIDC provider

## Permission Groups
- Every user belongs to exactly one permission group
- Groups define which scopes (permissions) the user has
- **Built-in groups** (cannot be modified): system-admin, admin, operator, viewer
- **Custom groups**: created by admins with any combination of scopes
- **Group nesting**: a group can inherit from one parent group (single level only). Inherited scopes are automatically added to the user's effective scopes.
- Nesting limit: only top-level groups can be parents — a nested group cannot itself have children

## Managing Users
- View all users: list_users
- Change a user's group: update_user_role(userId, groupId) — changes their permissions immediately
- Block/unblock users from the Administration UI/API; there is no current AI tool for blocking users.
- Users cannot be deleted (they're linked to audit logs), only blocked

## User Fields
- id, email, name, avatarUrl, groupId, groupName, groupScopes, additionalScopes, scopes, isBlocked
- lastLoginAt, loginCount, createdAt`,

  audit: `# Audit Log

All significant actions are logged.
- Fields: userId, action, resourceType, resourceId, details (JSON), ipAddress, userAgent, createdAt.
- Actions follow pattern: "resource.action" (e.g., "ca.create", "cert.revoke", "proxy.update").
- AI-initiated actions have details.ai_initiated: true.
- Query with get_audit_log: filter by action, resourceType, pagination.
- Housekeeping can auto-delete old entries (configurable retention).`,

  nginx: `# Nginx Management

Gateway manages nginx reverse proxies through daemon nodes running on remote servers.

## Architecture
- Each nginx node runs a Go daemon (\`nginx-daemon\`) alongside the host's native nginx installation
- The Gateway backend communicates with daemons over gRPC (port 9443) with mutual TLS
- Proxy hosts are assigned to specific nginx nodes — each host's config is generated by Gateway and pushed to the daemon
- The daemon writes the config files, tests with \`nginx -t\`, and reloads nginx gracefully

## Config Management
- Proxy host configs are generated from templates and written to the nginx \`conf.d/sites/\` directory
- Each proxy host becomes one nginx server block file
- Changes are atomic: write → test → reload (rollback on test failure)
- Global nginx.conf can be viewed and edited from the node detail page (Configuration tab)

## Config Templates
- Nginx templates define the server block structure for proxy hosts
- Built-in templates for common patterns (reverse proxy, redirect, etc.)
- Custom templates support variables: \`{{variableName}}\` replaced at render time
- Assigned to proxy hosts via nginxTemplateId — default template used if none specified

## Raw Config Mode
- When rawConfigEnabled is true on a proxy host, the template rendering is bypassed entirely
- The rawConfig field is used directly as the nginx server block content
- Useful for complex configurations that templates can't express
- Ordinary proxy host list/detail responses omit rawConfig and rawConfigEnabled
- Raw content can only be read through explicit raw config read/render paths with raw-read permission
- Requires proxy:raw:toggle and proxy:raw:write scopes
- proxy:raw:bypass can bypass dangerous raw directive validation for the same proxy host
- Use get_proxy_rendered_config to see the current generated config before switching to raw mode

## Monitoring
- **Stub status**: nginx stub_status module provides active connections, accepts, handled, requests, reading, writing, waiting
- **Access log parsing**: traffic stats by status code, response times, bandwidth
- **Health checks**: per-proxy-host backend health monitoring (configurable URL, interval, expected status)
- **Nginx logs**: access and error logs streamed via daemon, viewable per proxy host or per node

## SSL/TLS
- SSL certificates are deployed to nginx nodes as PEM files in the certs directory
- Config includes ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives
- HTTP/2 support togglable per proxy host
- OCSP stapling enabled by default when CA chain is available`,

  nodes: `# Nodes (Daemon Management)

Nodes are remote servers running Gateway daemons. Each daemon type manages different infrastructure.

## Node Types
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy node — runs nginx, manages proxy host configs, SSL certs, access lists. Requires nginx installed on the server.
- **monitoring**: Lightweight system monitoring agent — reports CPU, memory, disk, load, network. No nginx required. Useful for any server you want to monitor.
- **docker**: Container management node — manages Docker containers, images, volumes, networks. Requires Docker installed. Provides container console (exec), file browser, log streaming, environment/secrets management.

## How to Enroll a New Node (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Create the node in Gateway UI
Go to **Nodes** page → click **Enroll Node** → select the node type (nginx, docker, or monitoring) → optionally set a display name → click **Create**. This generates a **one-time enrollment token**, the Gateway gRPC certificate fingerprint, and setup commands.

### Step 2: Run the setup script on the target server
The UI shows ready-to-copy commands. Run one of these on the target server as root:

For **nginx** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://gitlab.wiolett.net/wiolett/gateway/-/raw/main/scripts/setup-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

For **docker** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://gitlab.wiolett.net/wiolett/gateway/-/raw/main/scripts/setup-docker-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

For **monitoring** nodes:
\`\`\`bash
curl -sSL https://gitlab.wiolett.net/wiolett/gateway/-/raw/main/scripts/setup-monitoring-node.sh | sudo bash -s -- \\
  --gateway <gateway-host>:9443 --token <enrollment-token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>
\`\`\`

The setup script:
1. Downloads the daemon binary to \`/usr/local/bin/<type>-daemon\`
2. Creates config at \`/etc/<type>-daemon/config.yaml\` with the gateway address, token, and certificate fingerprint
3. Creates a systemd service and enables it
4. Starts the daemon — it connects to the gateway and completes mTLS enrollment automatically

### Step 3: Verify connection
The node status changes from **pending** to **online** in the Nodes list once the daemon connects. The enrollment token is invalidated after first use.

## Assistant Tools
- list_nodes: list daemon nodes visible to the current user.
- get_node: inspect one node.
- execute_node_console_command: run one argv-style command on a node console. Use { nodeId, command: ["sh","-lc","..."] }. This is destructive, requires nodes:console, is available to MCP only when that OAuth scope is explicitly granted, and catastrophic patterns such as rm -rf / are blocked.
- create_node, rename_node, delete_node: manage node records.
- manage_node_config: read/update/test nginx node config. Use { operation: "read"|"update"|"test", nodeId, content? }. read requires nodes:config:view:<nodeId>; update/test require nodes:config:edit:<nodeId>. This tool is browser-session-only and is not available to MCP tokens.
- manage_node_file: manage node filesystem paths. This tool is browser-session-only and is not available to MCP tokens.

### Alternative: Manual installation
If you cannot use the setup script, you can install manually:
1. Download the daemon binary and place it at \`/usr/local/bin/<type>-daemon\`
2. Run: \`<type>-daemon install --gateway <host>:9443 --token <token> --gateway-cert-sha256 sha256:<gateway-cert-fingerprint>\`
   This creates the config file and systemd service automatically.
3. Enable and start: \`systemctl enable --now <type>-daemon\`

## Connection & Communication
- Daemons connect to the gateway via **gRPC on port 9443** with mutual TLS (mTLS).
- The gateway pushes commands to daemons: apply config, deploy certs, health check, log streaming, exec, etc.
- The daemon sends back: health reports (every 30s), command results, log entries, exec output.
- Daemons auto-reconnect on disconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 60s).
- mTLS certificates auto-renew when within 7 days of expiry.

## Console (Interactive Shell)
All node types support an interactive console — a PTY shell session on the host OS.
- Accessed via the **Console** tab on the node detail page.
- Requires \`nodes:console\` scope.
- Supports popout window, reconnection with output replay, and terminal resize.
- Shell auto-detected from \`/etc/shells\` (prefers bash > zsh > ash > sh).
- Can be configured to run as a specific OS user via \`console.user\` in daemon config.
- The assistant has a separate one-shot \`execute_node_console_command\` tool for command execution when regular Gateway read/manage tools cannot answer the request. Prefer argv commands such as \`["sh","-lc","systemctl status nginx"]\`.
- Treat every console command as destructive: risky commands require explicit approval and obviously host-breaking commands are blocked before reaching the daemon.
- Use console tools for host-level inspection or repair only after identifying the exact node with get_current_context or find_resource. Do not guess node IDs from chat text.

## System Information
Daemons report hardware/OS info on registration:
- CPU model, core count, architecture (amd64, arm64)
- Kernel version, hostname, OS info
- Uptime, file descriptor usage
- Disk mounts with usage percentages
- Network interfaces with RX/TX stats

## Monitoring & Health
- **Health reports** (every 30s): CPU%, memory, disk, load average, swap, network I/O, open FDs.
- **Nginx nodes** additionally report: nginx status, uptime, worker count, error rates (4xx/5xx), stub status stats.
- **Docker nodes** additionally report: container count (running/stopped/total), per-container CPU/memory/network stats, Docker version.
- **Traffic stats** (nginx only): parsed from access logs — status code distribution, response times.
- Background polling at 10s intervals; 5s when a user is actively viewing the node detail page.

## Node Management
- **Rename**: change display name (does not affect hostname).
- **Delete**: removes the node from Gateway. The daemon will fail to reconnect (mTLS cert becomes invalid).
- **Pin to sidebar**: quick-access link in the sidebar navigation.
- **Default node**: one nginx node can be marked as default — used for proxy operations when no specific node is selected.

## Key Fields
- id, hostname, displayName, type, status (pending/online/offline/error)
- lastSeenAt, capabilities (daemon version, features, system info)
- certificateSerial (mTLS cert), enrollmentTokenHash
- metadata (extensible metadata object)`,

  housekeeping: `# Housekeeping

  docker: `# Docker Container Management

## Overview
Gateway provides Portainer-like Docker container management through a daemon running on Docker hosts. All Docker operations are node-scoped — you must specify which Docker node to target.

## Container Lifecycle
- **Create**: Deploy from image with ports, volumes, env, networks, restart policy
- **Start/Stop/Restart/Kill**: Lifecycle management (transitions tracked as tasks)
- **Recreate**: Stop + remove + create with new config (preserves name, secrets auto-injected)
- **Duplicate**: Clone a container with a new name (secrets are copied too)
- **Remove**: Delete container (must be stopped first)

## Recreated Containers and Stale IDs
Docker container IDs are volatile. Recreate, image update, webhook rollout, or config changes can remove the old
container and create a new one with the same semantic workload/name. If a Docker tool returns "No such container",
do not conclude the workload is deleted. Use \`find_resource\` with the last known container name, nodeId, image, or
other stable hint to locate the recreated container and continue with its new ID.

## Environment Variables & Secrets
- Regular env vars: stored in container config, visible to all users with view access
- Secrets: encrypted at rest in Gateway DB, injected as env vars on container start/recreate. Only users with docker:containers:secrets scope can view decrypted values. Secrets are keyed by container name so they survive recreates.

## Image Updates & Webhooks
- **Manual image tag change**: in container Settings, the Image Tag field allows changing the version. Changing the tag and clicking Recreate will pull the new image and recreate the container.
- **Webhook updates**: each container can have a webhook URL enabled (Settings → Webhook section). CI pipelines POST to the webhook URL to trigger automatic pull + recreate. URL format: \`POST /api/webhooks/docker/<token>\` with optional body \`{"tag":"v1.2.3"}\`. No auth header needed — the token in the URL is the auth.
- **Auto-cleanup**: webhook config supports automatic cleanup of old image versions after updates, with configurable retention count.
- Webhook configuration requires the \`docker:containers:webhooks\` scope.
- Use \`update_docker_container_image\` tool to change a container's image tag programmatically (pulls + recreates).

## Blue/Green Deployments
- Deployments are Gateway-managed blue/green services with a stable deployment ID, active slot, inactive slot, router, routes, health checks, and release history.
- Managed deployment containers are protected. Do not start, stop, restart, kill, remove, rename, or update the underlying slot container directly.
- Use \`list_docker_deployments\` and \`get_docker_deployment\` to find the deployment ID, active slot, routes, and health.
- Use \`start_docker_deployment\`, \`stop_docker_deployment\`, \`restart_docker_deployment\`, \`kill_docker_deployment\`, \`deploy_docker_deployment\`, \`switch_docker_deployment_slot\`, \`rollback_docker_deployment\`, and \`stop_docker_deployment_slot\` for deployment-safe lifecycle operations.
- To roll out a new image or tag for a deployment, use \`deploy_docker_deployment\` instead of \`update_docker_container_image\`.

## Settings
- **Runtime (live-update)**: restart policy, memory limit, CPU shares, PID limit — applied without recreation
- **Requires recreate**: port mappings, volume mounts, entrypoint, command, stop grace period, working dir, hostname, labels, image tag
- **Stop grace period**: container-level Docker stop timeout in seconds (0-300). Stop/restart tools use this configured value when no explicit timeout is supplied, falling back to 20 seconds.

## Images, Volumes, Networks
- Images: list, pull from registries, remove, prune unused
- Volumes: list, create, remove (shows which containers use each volume)
- Networks: list, create, remove, connect/disconnect containers

## Registries & Templates
- Registries: add private Docker registries with encrypted credentials. Global or node-specific scope.
- Templates: save container configurations as reusable templates for quick deployment

## Tasks
Long-running operations (stop, restart, kill, recreate, update) create tasks visible on the Tasks page. Tasks track progress and completion status.

## Console & Files
- Console: interactive terminal (exec) into running containers via xterm.js WebSocket
- Assistant console command: \`execute_docker_container_console_command({ nodeId, containerId, command: ["sh","-lc","..."], user? })\` runs one command in a container when ordinary Docker tools do not cover the needed inspection or repair. It requires \`docker:containers:console\`, is destructive, is available to MCP only when that OAuth scope is explicitly granted, and blocks catastrophic patterns such as \`rm -rf /\`.
- Before using container console, resolve the current container through get_current_context or find_resource. Container IDs can change after recreate, so re-check by name when a command reports "No such container".
- File browser: navigate filesystem, view/edit files inside containers

## Key Notes
- Most Docker tools require a nodeId parameter. If the user names a container/image/volume/network, use find_resource first; it returns nodeId with the match. Use list_nodes with type="docker" only when you specifically need to choose or inspect Docker nodes.
- Container IDs change after recreate/update — the frontend handles navigation to new IDs
- Transition states (stopping, restarting, recreating, deploying, switching, etc.) block concurrent operations on the same container or deployment`,

  databases: `# Databases

## Overview
Gateway can store and operate external Postgres and Redis connections directly from the backend. No daemon is involved.

## Providers
- **Postgres**: schema/table explorer, paginated row browser, row insert/update/delete for PK-backed tables, SQL console, monitoring.
- **Redis**: key browser, type-aware viewer/editor for common types (string, hash, list, set, zset), Redis command console, monitoring.

## Credentials
- Connection credentials are encrypted at rest in the Gateway database using the same envelope-encryption primitive used for Docker secrets and PKI keys.
- Raw credentials are hidden by default. Revealing them requires the \`databases:credentials:reveal\` scope.
- Team members can operate databases through Gateway without being given the raw hosting credentials.

## Permissions
- \`databases:view\`, \`databases:create\`, \`databases:edit\`, \`databases:delete\`
- \`databases:query:read\`, \`databases:query:write\`, \`databases:query:admin\`; AI/MCP query tools also require \`databases:view\` on the same database.
- \`databases:credentials:reveal\`
- Most database scopes are resource-scopable by database ID, so access can be limited per saved connection.

## Monitoring
- Gateway stores short rolling metric history for database sparklines and persists health-history entries for health bars.
- Postgres metrics include latency and active connection utilization.
- Redis metrics include latency and memory utilization.

## Audit
- Connection CRUD, connection tests, credential reveals, data mutations, and console executions are audit logged.
- Query text and command text are sanitized and truncated in the audit log to avoid leaking secrets.`,

  postgres: `# Postgres in Gateway

## Explorer
- Schemas and tables are discovered from \`information_schema\`.
- Row editing in the visual explorer requires a primary key. Tables or views without a PK are browse-only in the explorer.
- Explorer pages are paginated; use the SQL console for advanced filtering or bulk operations.

## SQL Console
- One or more SQL statements can be executed per request.
- Read, write, and admin statements are separated by permissions: \`databases:query:read\`, \`databases:query:write\`, and \`databases:query:admin\`. AI/MCP execution also requires \`databases:view\` for the target saved connection.

## Monitoring
- Health is based on connectivity and latency.
- Metrics include \`latency_ms\`, \`active_connections\`, \`max_connections\`, \`active_connections_pct\`, and \`database_size_bytes\`.`,

  redis: `# Redis in Gateway

## Explorer
- Keys are discovered with \`SCAN\`, not \`KEYS\`, so the browser can safely handle large keyspaces.
- Visual editing supports string, hash, list, set, and zset.
- Streams are browse-only in the visual explorer; use the command console for advanced stream operations.

## Command Console
- One or more Redis commands can be executed per request.
- Read, write, and admin commands are permission-gated by \`databases:query:read\`, \`databases:query:write\`, and \`databases:query:admin\`. AI/MCP execution also requires \`databases:view\` for the target saved connection.

## Monitoring
- Health is based on connectivity and latency.
- Metrics include \`latency_ms\`, \`used_memory_bytes\`, \`maxmemory_bytes\`, \`memory_pct\`, \`connected_clients\`, and \`instantaneous_ops_per_sec\`.`,

  logging: `# External Logging

Gateway can ingest structured logs from external services into ClickHouse-backed logging environments.

## Resource Types
Use manage_logging with singular resource names:
- Environments: { resource: "environment", operation: "list"|"get"|"create"|"update"|"delete" }
- Schemas: { resource: "schema", operation: "list"|"get"|"create"|"update"|"delete" }
- Ingest tokens: { resource: "token", operation: "list"|"create"|"delete", environmentId }
- Logs: { resource: "logs", operation: "search", environmentId, payload }
- Facets: { resource: "facets", operation: "facets", environmentId, payload }
- Metadata: { resource: "metadata", operation: "metadata", environmentId }

## Important Tool Argument Rules
- Canonical tool resources are singular: "environment", "schema", "token". Do not copy plural REST nouns like "schemas" unless you have to; use the singular canonical form.
- Create/update/search bodies go in payload, not at the top level.
- Use find_resource({ query, types: ["logging_environment"] }) or find_resource({ query, types: ["logging_schema"] }) when the user names an environment/schema and you need its ID.

## Schema Payload
\`\`\`json
{
  "resource": "schema",
  "operation": "create",
  "payload": {
    "name": "Application Logs",
    "slug": "application-logs",
    "description": "Structured application events",
    "schemaMode": "loose",
    "fieldSchema": [
      { "key": "service", "location": "label", "type": "string", "required": true },
      { "key": "durationMs", "location": "field", "type": "number", "required": false }
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

schemaMode:
- loose: accept unknown labels/fields
- strip: drop unknown labels/fields
- reject: reject events with unknown labels/fields

fieldSchema entries:
- key: safe key matching letters/numbers/underscore/dot/dash rules
- location: "label" or "field"
- type: labels must be "string"; fields can be "string", "number", "boolean", "datetime", or "json"
- required: whether every event must include the key

## Environment Payload
\`\`\`json
{
  "resource": "environment",
  "operation": "create",
  "payload": {
    "name": "Production",
    "slug": "production",
    "enabled": true,
    "schemaId": null,
    "schemaMode": "reject",
    "retentionDays": 30,
    "fieldSchema": []
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Searching Logs
\`\`\`json
{
  "resource": "logs",
  "operation": "search",
  "environmentId": "<logging environment UUID>",
  "payload": {
    "query": "error",
    "limit": 100,
    "services": ["gateway-backend"],
    "sources": ["codex-smoke"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Ingest Tokens
- Create tokens with { resource: "token", operation: "create", environmentId, payload: { name, expiresAt? } }.
- The raw token is shown only once. Do not expose it unless the user explicitly needs to configure an ingest client.`,

  folders: `# Foldered Resources

Gateway uses shared folder views for several resource lists. Use folder tools instead of guessing REST paths.

## Tools
- list_resource_folders({ resourceType, dockerResourceType? }) lists folders and visible assignments.
- manage_resource_folder({ resourceType, operation, ... }) mutates folder trees and item placement.

## Resource Types
- nodes
- databases
- domains
- logging_environments
- logging_schemas
- admin_users
- permission_groups
- proxy_hosts
- docker with dockerResourceType: container, image, network, or volume

## Operations
- create: { name, parentId? }
- update: { folderId, name?, parentId? }
- delete: { folderId }
- reorder_folders: { items: [{ id, sortOrder }] }
- move_resources: { folderId, resourceIds }
- reorder_resources: { items: [{ id, sortOrder }] }
- move_folder is supported only where the underlying resource service supports moving folders.

## Scope Rules
- nodes: list with nodes:details or nodes:folders:manage; mutate with nodes:folders:manage.
- databases: list with databases:view or databases:folders:manage; mutate with databases:folders:manage.
- domains: list with domains:view; mutate with domains:folders:manage.
- logging_environments: list with logs:environments:view, logs:environments:folders:manage, or logs:manage; mutate with logs:environments:folders:manage or logs:manage.
- logging_schemas: list with logs:schemas:view, logs:schemas:folders:manage, or logs:manage; mutate with logs:schemas:folders:manage or logs:manage.
- admin_users: list with admin:users or admin:users:folders:manage; mutate with admin:users:folders:manage.
- permission_groups: list with admin:groups or admin:groups:folders:manage; mutate with admin:groups:folders:manage.
- proxy_hosts: list with proxy:view or proxy:folders:manage; mutate folders with proxy:folders:manage; moving hosts also checks proxy:edit for each host.
- docker: list uses dockerResourceType-specific view scope: docker:containers:view, docker:images:view, docker:networks:view, or docker:volumes:view. Folder mutation uses docker:containers:folders:manage. Moving or reordering container placements also checks docker:containers:edit for each item node; image, network, and volume placement follows the shared Docker folder route and does not require container edit scope.`,

  'node-files': `# Node File Management

Use manage_node_file for node filesystem operations. This works through the node daemon and follows the same validation as the node Files UI.

## Operations
- list: { nodeId, operation: "list", path? }
- read: { nodeId, operation: "read", path, encoding?: "auto"|"utf8"|"base64", limitBytes? }
- write: { nodeId, operation: "write", path, content? or contentBase64? }
- create: { nodeId, operation: "create", path, content? or contentBase64? }
- mkdir: { nodeId, operation: "mkdir", path }
- delete: { nodeId, operation: "delete", path }
- move: { nodeId, operation: "move", fromPath, toPath }
- upload_init: { nodeId, operation: "upload_init", path, totalBytes }
- upload_chunk: { nodeId, operation: "upload_chunk", uploadId, offset, contentBase64 }
- upload_complete: { nodeId, operation: "upload_complete", uploadId, path, totalBytes }
- upload_abort: { nodeId, operation: "upload_abort", uploadId }

Read output is capped and returns { encoding, content, sizeBytes, returnedBytes, truncated }. Use base64 for binary files.`,

  sandbox: `# Sandbox Runner

Sandbox tools run bounded commands in Docker containers owned by the current user. They are AI-only and intentionally not exposed through MCP.

## Execution Tools
- execute_script: run a short script in a fresh container, return output, then remove the container.
- run_process: start a longer process with a TTL.
- read_process_output: read stdout/stderr from a running process.
- write_process_stdin: send stdin to a running process.
- kill_process: stop a running sandbox process.
- list_sandbox_jobs: list current user's running sandbox jobs.

## Network and Artifacts
Sandbox containers have no direct network access. Use Gateway-mediated helpers:
- fetch: read network content through Gateway, capped at 10 MB.
- download_artifact: download a URL through Gateway and place it in a running sandbox under /workspace, capped at 200 MB.
- list_artifact_files: list files/directories already present in a running sandbox workspace without starting another process.
- read_artifact: read a file from the sandbox in chunks, capped per read.
- send_artifact: save a sandbox file as a Gateway-managed downloadable artifact for the user.

Artifact path rules:
- The sandbox process working directory is /workspace.
- Files that must be read_artifact or send_artifact must be written under /workspace.
- Artifact tool path arguments are relative to /workspace. Example: write /workspace/report.txt, then send_artifact with path "report.txt".
- If a sandbox-backed tool returns a processId and path, use list_artifact_files and read_artifact with that same processId/path to inspect files; do not launch another run_process just to run ls/find/os.walk/cat.
- Do not write deliverable files under /tmp, and do not pass absolute paths such as "/workspace/report.txt" or relative paths like "tmp/report.txt" for files created in /tmp.
- run_process returns as soon as the process starts. If a file is created by a running process, wait briefly and verify it with read_process_output or read_artifact before send_artifact.

When send_artifact succeeds, do not print the download URL in a markdown table or manual link. The chat UI automatically attaches the file card from the tool result; respond with a short confirmation such as "Attached the file."

Resource tiers are low, medium, and high. TTL is capped by tier. The agent may request ttlSeconds but cannot exceed the tier cap.`,

  conversations: `# AI Conversations and Lite Mode

AI conversations are stored on the backend. Tool discovery is conversation-scoped, so discovered toolsets remain available when returning to a saved conversation.

## Context
- get_current_context returns the current UI route and focused resource when the user says "this page" or "current resource".
- compact summarizes older conversation history when context grows.
- Recent conversations are loaded from the backend, not local storage.
- manage_ai_conversation can list, read, and delete the current user's saved conversations:
  - { operation: "list" }
  - { operation: "get", conversationId }
  - { operation: "delete", conversationId }
  - { operation: "delete_by_title", title }
- manage_ai_conversation never creates, rewrites, or repairs conversation history. Use the chat UI/runtime for saving active messages.
- end_conversation closes the current chat with a localized reason. Use it only when the conversation should stop, especially after the third unrelated/off-topic request in the same conversation.
- If context is exhausted, the UI can block the composer and offer to clear the oldest saved context. Do not keep retrying the same oversized request.

## Lite Mode
Lite mode is an AI-first desktop layout. The assistant becomes the main screen, the sidebar shows recent and pinned conversations, and Settings/Administration/top-level pages keep a back button to return to chat.

Do not assume the current page from chat text. Use get_current_context when the user refers to their visible page.`,

  'status-page': `# Status Pages

Gateway can publish status-page data from monitored services and incidents. Use manage_status_page for settings, services, incidents, updates, proxy-template choices, and preview.

## Resources and Operations
- settings: { resource: "settings", operation: "get"|"update", payload? }
- proxy_templates: { resource: "proxy_templates", operation: "list" }
- services: { resource: "services", operation: "list"|"create"|"update"|"delete", serviceId?, payload? }
- incidents: { resource: "incidents", operation: "list"|"create"|"update"|"delete"|"resolve"|"promote", incidentId?, status?, limit?, payload? }
- incident_updates: { resource: "incident_updates", operation: "create_update", incidentId, payload }
- preview: { resource: "preview", operation: "preview" }

Scopes: status-page:view for reads/preview, status-page:manage for settings/services, and status-page:incidents:create, status-page:incidents:update, status-page:incidents:resolve, or status-page:incidents:delete for incident mutations.`,

  api: `# Gateway REST API

Gateway provides REST access for external scripts, CI/CD pipelines, CLI tools, and integrations without a browser session.
Programmatic REST clients can use either Gateway API tokens (\`gw_\`) or OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE access tokens (\`gwo_\`). AI assistant access, AI configuration, MCP user access, auth administration, raw nginx config, gateway settings, node raw config, node filesystem access, \`proxy:raw:bypass\`, and \`proxy:advanced:bypass\` cannot be delegated to API/OAuth tokens. MCP clients use OAuth access tokens for the MCP resource with ordinary delegated API scopes; the owning user account must have \`mcp:use\`. Node config and node file-management assistant tools are intentionally AI-session-only and are not exposed through MCP.

## Current-User OAuth Authorizations
The assistant can manage existing OAuth authorizations for the current browser user with manage_oauth_authorization:
- { operation: "list" }
- { operation: "update_scopes", clientId, resource, scopes }
- { operation: "revoke", clientId, resource }

Pending OAuth consent remains browser-only. Do not try to approve a new OAuth client through tools.

## Current-User Gateway API Tokens
The assistant can manage the current browser user's Gateway API tokens with manage_api_token:
- { operation: "list" }
- { operation: "create", name, scopes }
- { operation: "update", tokenId, name?, scopes? }
- { operation: "revoke", tokenId }

Token scopes must be a subset of the current user's scopes. Token secrets are returned only by create and cannot be read later. manage_api_token is browser-session-only and is not exposed through MCP.

## Creating an API Token
1. Go to **Settings** page → **API Tokens** section
2. Click **Create Token** → enter a name and select the scopes (permissions) the token should have
3. Token scopes must be a subset of your own group's scopes — you cannot grant permissions you don't have
4. The token is shown **once** after creation (prefixed with \`gw_\`) — copy and store it securely
5. Tokens cannot be retrieved after creation — if lost, revoke and create a new one

## Authentication
Programmatic API requests authenticate via the \`Authorization\` header:

\`\`\`bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer gw_your_token_here" https://gateway.example.com/api/cas
\`\`\`

Token format: \`gw_\` followed by 64 hex characters.
OAuth access tokens use the \`gwo_\` prefix and the same Bearer header. Browser-only endpoints still require the HttpOnly session cookie and CSRF token where applicable.

## Base URL
All endpoints are under \`/api/\`. Example: \`https://gateway.example.com/api/cas\`

## Key Endpoints

### Access Lists
- \`GET /api/access-lists\` — list access lists
- \`POST /api/access-lists\` — create access list

### Browser-only administration
- \`/auth/*\`, \`/api/oauth/consent/*\`, \`/api/oauth/authorizations/*\`, \`/api/admin/users\`, \`/api/admin/groups\`, \`/api/tokens\`, \`/api/ai/*\`, raw nginx config endpoints, and system update mutations require a browser session.
- \`GET /api/audit\` — query audit log

## Response Format
- Success: JSON body with the resource data
- Errors: \`{ "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human-readable description" }\`
- List endpoints return: \`{ "data": [...], "total": N, "page": 1, "totalPages": N }\`

## Rate Limits & Pagination
- Default page size: 20 items. Use \`?page=N&limit=N\` for pagination (max 100).
- Search: \`?search=term\` on list endpoints for text filtering.
- Filter by type: \`?type=nginx\` on nodes, \`?status=running\` on containers.

## Scopes
Token permissions are controlled by scopes. Each endpoint requires specific scopes. A token with only \`pki:cert:view\` can list certificates but cannot issue or revoke them. See the permissions topic for the full scope list.

## Token Management
- Tokens are tied to the user who created them
- Revoking a token invalidates it immediately
- Token last-used timestamp is tracked for auditing
- Tokens inherit the user's resource restrictions (if the user's group restricts a scope to specific resources, the token is similarly restricted)`,

  'ai-settings': `# AI Assistant Settings

AI assistant settings control the provider, request limits, tool exposure, web search, and sandbox runner. Use these tools instead of guessing from UI labels:

## Tools
- get_ai_settings: read provider, model, limits, system prompt, tool access, web search, and sandbox runner settings.
- update_ai_settings: update supported assistant settings. Send only fields that should change.
- list_ai_tools: list available assistant tools with categories, scopes, descriptions, and whether they are destructive.
- get_sandbox_runtime_status: read sandbox runner enablement and runtime health.

## Provider Settings
- providerUrl: OpenAI-compatible API base URL.
- endpointMode: auto, chat_completions, or responses.
- model: provider model name.
- apiKey: only set this when replacing the stored provider key. The current secret is never returned in full.

## Limits
- rateLimitMax and rateLimitWindowSeconds: rate limit for assistant requests.
- maxToolRounds: maximum sequential tool-call rounds in one assistant run.
- maxContextTokens: context budget used by the conversation builder.
- maxCompletionTokens and maxTokensField: response token cap and provider field name.
- reasoningEffort: low, medium, high, or none. Use none for models/providers that do not support reasoning controls.

## Tool Access
- disabledTools: exact tool names hidden from the assistant.
- webSearchProvider, webSearchBaseUrl, and webSearchApiKey: provider selection, optional provider URL, and secret replacement for web search.
- sandboxEnabled and sandboxDefaultTier: sandbox runner exposure and default tier.

## Sandbox Runner
- sandboxEnabled: expose sandbox execution and artifact tools to the assistant.
- sandboxDefaultTier: default resource tier. The agent may request a tier only if the user has the required scope.
- Sandbox tools are intentionally excluded from MCP exposure and are available only to the assistant when enabled and permitted.`,

  gitlab: `# GitLab Integrations

Gateway GitLab connectors are configured by admins in Settings -> Integrations. Embedded AI users authorize each connector with their own encrypted PAT unless they have the explicit integrations:gitlab:system scope. GitLab tools are not exposed through Gateway MCP; external agents should configure their own GitLab MCP connection.

## Discovery
- Use gitlab_list_connectors to find enabled connectors.
- If Gateway asks for GitLab authorization, wait for the user to complete or cancel the authorization modal. Never ask the user to paste a PAT into chat.
- Use gitlab_list_projects or gitlab_search_projects to find projects already synced through Gateway allowlist rules.
- Project arguments accept the synced project remote ID or full path.
- Every GitLab tool except gitlab_list_connectors requires the exact connectorId UUID from gitlab_list_connectors or from a prior GitLab project result. Do not use connector names, project paths, or blank values as connectorId.
- If a visible GitLab project exists but is not enabled in the connector allowlist, use gitlab_add_connector_projects with explicit approval, then gitlab_sync_connector.
- Do not guess connector IDs or scan GitLab directly outside these tools.

## Repository Access
- Prefer direct API tools for ordinary read/write work:
  - gitlab_list_repository_tree for folders.
  - gitlab_read_file for bounded file reads. Use offset and length for large files.
  - gitlab_commit_files for create/update/delete/move commits.
- Use gitlab_clone_repository_to_sandbox only when local analysis, tests, or multi-file tooling actually requires a checkout.
- After gitlab_clone_repository_to_sandbox, wait for CLONE_READY with read_process_output, then inspect the checkout through list_artifact_files/read_artifact on the returned processId. Do not call run_process merely to list or read cloned repository files.
- Clone runs with connector-configured limits: shallow clone, depth, LFS/submodule settings, max size, and timeout.

## CI
- Use gitlab_lint_ci_config before committing CI changes.
- Use gitlab_update_ci_config for the first-class .gitlab-ci.yml edit workflow. Invalid CI config is not committed.
- Use pipeline/job tools to inspect CI status and bounded job logs.

## Variables, Webhooks, and Deploy Tokens
- gitlab_list_project_variables returns metadata only; variable values are never returned.
- gitlab_set_project_variable accepts a secret value but the value must not be repeated in responses or explanations.
- gitlab_delete_project_variable always requires explicit tool approval.
- Webhook management uses GitLab project webhook tools and must respect connector allowlist and Gateway scopes.
- gitlab_create_deploy_token captures the raw deploy token only inside Gateway, encrypts it as connector-managed credentials, and returns masked metadata only.
- If a project registry is disabled, use gitlab_update_project_settings with containerRegistryAccessLevel=enabled after approval. That tool runs a connector sync afterward and reports sync or syncError; use gitlab_sync_connector only if you need to retry a failed sync or refresh metadata later.

## Safety Rules
- Gateway scopes, connector allowlist, provider capabilities, and tool approval rules are authoritative. GitLab PAT permissions are only an upper bound.
- Direct commits to protected/default branches are allowed only when Gateway approval rules and the GitLab PAT both allow it.
- Never ask the user to paste connector PATs, deploy token values, or project variable secrets into chat unless the current tool call explicitly needs one-time secret input.
- Audit logs store metadata and optional diff hashes, not raw secrets or full diffs.`,

  notifications: `# Webhook Notifications

## Overview
The notification system sends HTTP webhook notifications when alert conditions are met. It supports threshold-based alerts (CPU, memory, disk) and event-based alerts (node offline, container stopped, etc.).

## Alert Rules
Each alert rule defines:
- **Category**: node, container, proxy, certificate, database_postgres, or database_redis
- **Type**: threshold (metric breaches a value) or event (something happens)
- **Threshold fields** (for threshold type): metric, metricTarget (optional sub-target such as a specific node disk mount), operator (>, >=, <, <=), thresholdValue, durationSeconds (fire observation window), fireThresholdPercent (percent of probes in that window that must breach), resolveAfterSeconds (resolve observation window, default 60s), resolveThresholdPercent (percent of probes in that window that must be clear)
- **Event fields** (for event type): eventPattern (offline, stopped, oom_killed, etc.)
- **Scope**: resourceIds — specific nodes/containers/certs to monitor (empty = all)
- **Severity**: info, warning, critical
- **Webhooks**: webhookIds — which webhooks receive notifications from this rule
- **Message template**: Handlebars template rendered with event-specific variables
- **Cooldown**: cooldownSeconds — won't re-fire within this period (default 900s = 15 min)

## Webhooks
Webhooks define where notifications are delivered:
- URL, HTTP method (POST/PUT/PATCH/GET)
- Body template (Handlebars) with preset options: Discord, Slack, Telegram, Generic JSON, Plain Text
- Custom headers (key-value pairs)
- HMAC-SHA256 signing with configurable secret and header name
- Delivery log with retry (5 attempts, exponential backoff)

## Handlebars Template Variables
Available in message templates (per-alert) and body templates (per-webhook):

### Common variables (all alerts)
- \`{{alert_name}}\` — alert rule name
- \`{{severity}}\` — alert severity (info/warning/critical)
- \`{{severity_emoji}}\` — emoji for severity
- \`{{resource.name}}\` — resource display name
- \`{{resource.id}}\` — resource ID
- \`{{resource.type}}\` — resource type (node/container/proxy/certificate)
- \`{{timestamp}}\` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- \`{{fired_at}}\` — when alert started firing
- \`{{fired_duration}}\` — seconds the alert was firing (on resolve)

### Threshold-specific variables
- \`{{value}}\` — current metric value
- \`{{threshold}}\` — configured threshold
- \`{{operator}}\` — comparison operator
- \`{{metric}}\` — metric name (cpu, memory, disk)
- \`{{duration}}\` — configured fire-after duration (e.g. "5m")
- \`{{node_name}}\` / \`{{hostname}}\` — node hostname

### Category-specific variables
- Container: \`{{node_name}}\` — hosting node
- Proxy: \`{{health_status}}\` — health status
- Certificate: \`{{days_until_expiry}}\`, \`{{expiry_date}}\`
- Database: \`{{metric}}\`, \`{{value}}\`, \`{{threshold}}\`, and \`{{resource.name}}\`

## Database Alert Categories
- database_postgres metrics: latency_ms, active_connections_pct, database_size_mb.
- database_redis metrics: latency_ms, memory_pct.
- database health events: health.offline, health.degraded, health.online. These events can also be used with threshold-style observation windows when supportsThreshold is true.

## Handlebars Helpers
Available in all templates:

### Comparison & logic
\`{{#if (gt value 90)}}CRITICAL{{else}}OK{{/if}}\`, \`eq\`, \`ne\`, \`gt\`, \`lt\`, \`gte\`, \`lte\`, \`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\`

### Formatting
- \`{{round value 1}}\` — round to N decimals (e.g. 11.237 → 11.2)
- \`{{uppercase str}}\`, \`{{lowercase str}}\`
- \`{{truncate str 50}}\` — truncate with ellipsis
- \`{{json obj}}\` — JSON.stringify
- \`{{default value "N/A"}}\` — fallback for null/undefined
- \`{{join array ", "}}\` — join array elements

### Math & calculations
- \`{{math value "+" 10}}\` — arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- \`{{percent used total}}\` — calculate percentage
- \`{{round (math value "/" 1024) 2}}\` — combine helpers

### Time & dates
- \`{{formatDuration seconds}}\` — human format: "5m 30s", "2h 15m"
- \`{{timeago timestamp}}\` — relative: "3 minutes ago"
- \`{{dateformat timestamp "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"}}\` — custom format
- Format tokens: YYYY, MM, DD, HH, mm, ss

### Text
- \`{{pluralize count "container" "containers"}}\` — singular/plural

## Template Examples
- \`CPU at {{round value 1}}% on {{resource.name}} (threshold: {{operator}} {{threshold}}%)\`
- \`{{resource.name}} {{metric}} has been above {{threshold}}% for {{duration}}\`
- \`Resolved after {{formatDuration fired_duration}} — {{metric}} now at {{round value 1}}%\`
- \`{{#if (gt value 95)}}🔥 CRITICAL{{else}}⚠️ Warning{{/if}}: {{alert_name}}\`
