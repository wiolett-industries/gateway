# Gateway

Self-hosted infrastructure control plane for reverse proxies, Docker workloads, certificates, databases, logs, monitoring, status pages, and automation.

> [!NOTE]
> Primary development happens on [Wiolett Industries GitLab](https://gitlab.wiolett.net/wiolett/gateway). The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wiolett-industries/gateway) is a public mirror. Issues and feature requests are welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/wiolett-industries/gateway/issues).

## Why Gateway

Gateway gives small infrastructure teams one product for the daily work that usually lives across nginx configs, shell scripts, Docker hosts, certificate folders, database clients, dashboards, and alert tools.

Use it when you want to:

- Operate multiple proxy, Docker, and monitoring nodes without opening inbound management ports on those nodes.
- Give operators a focused UI and API for production tasks without giving them root shell access.
- Centralize TLS, internal PKI, ACME certificates, domains, status pages, notifications, and audit history.
- Manage Docker containers, deployments, logs, files, consoles, secrets, and registry workflows from one place.
- Expose controlled automation through API tokens, OAuth, CI/CD webhooks, and MCP clients.

## Fastest Install

Install Gateway on a Linux server with Docker:

```bash
curl -sSL https://gitlab.wiolett.net/wiolett/gateway/-/raw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Production deployment note:** Gateway is a privileged infrastructure control plane. For internal operations such as self-updates and local housekeeping, the Gateway app mounts the host Docker socket. Run Gateway in an isolated VM or dedicated host, and do not place unrelated workloads on the same Docker host.

> [!WARNING]
> **OIDC required:** For security reasons, Gateway currently supports only SSO login through an OpenID Connect provider. There is no built-in username/password authentication, so you need an OIDC provider configured before users can sign in.

Expose the ports that match your deployment:

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `3000/tcp` | Gateway app UI/API port. For behind-NAT installs, expose this on the local network and point your external reverse proxy to it. |
| `443/tcp` | Public HTTPS UI/API access when Gateway's installer configures nginx alongside Gateway and sets up the domain. |
| `80/tcp` | HTTP and ACME HTTP-01 challenge, only if that challenge mode is used. |
| `9443/tcp` | gRPC control plane for managed daemon connections. |

Behind NAT or an existing external reverse proxy, publish `3000/tcp` only on the local network and configure the external proxy to forward the public Gateway domain to `http://<gateway-lan-ip>:3000`. If you let the installer configure nginx alongside Gateway for the Gateway domain, only `443/tcp` is required for UI/API access. Managed nodes still connect outbound to Gateway on `9443/tcp`; they do not need inbound management ports.

The installer asks for your domain, OIDC provider, SSL mode, resource profile, and log rotation settings. When it finishes, open Gateway, sign in, and add your first node.

For flags, non-interactive installs, custom SSL, OIDC details, updates, and node setup, read the [installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## How It Works

Gateway runs as a Docker stack on the control-plane server. Managed hosts run small Go daemons that connect outbound to Gateway over gRPC with mTLS.

```text
                Gateway server
        +-----------------------------+
        | app + postgres + redis      |
        | optional clickhouse         |
        | gRPC :9443                  |
        +-------------+---------------+
                      |
                outbound mTLS
                      |
        +-------------+-------------------+
        |             |                   |
 nginx-daemon   docker-daemon     monitoring-daemon
 proxy host     container host    metrics-only host
```

Nodes do not need inbound management ports. Public traffic ports, such as `80` and `443` on nginx nodes, are still required for the services you expose.

## Security Model

Gateway is designed to be secure by default for a self-hosted infrastructure control plane:

- User login is SSO-only through OIDC, so password policy, MFA, device posture, and identity lifecycle stay with your identity provider.
- Managed nodes connect outbound to Gateway over gRPC with mTLS. First enrollment requires a one-time token plus the generated Gateway gRPC certificate fingerprint, and the daemon verifies the Gateway TLS leaf before sending the token. After enrollment, daemon commands require a client certificate issued by Gateway's internal node CA.
- Each node certificate is bound to a node identity. Gateway checks the mTLS certificate identity before accepting control streams, log streams, and certificate renewal requests.
- Nodes do not need inbound management ports. Losing Gateway access does not stop existing nginx configs or Docker containers; it only pauses centralized control.
- API tokens, OAuth grants, MCP access, database credentials, certificate exports, and secret reveal operations are scope-gated, bounded by the owning user's current permissions, and audited.
- Private key material and stored infrastructure credentials are encrypted at rest with the configured `PKI_MASTER_KEY`.

The result is a PKI-backed trust model: short-lived enrollment tokens get a node into the system only after the daemon confirms it is talking to the pinned Gateway certificate, and long-term trust is based on certificate identity rather than reusable shared secrets. This gives Gateway a strong default posture against token interception during setup and node hijacking after enrollment. Read the [security model](docs/security.md) for the full explanation and deployment hardening checklist.

## Roadmap

Gateway is already focused on production operations rather than a narrow MVP. The active direction is to make it safer, easier to operate, and more useful across medium and small infrastructure fleets.

Completed foundations:

- [x] Multi-node nginx reverse proxy management over outbound gRPC with mTLS.
- [x] Docker host management with deployments, webhooks, registries, logs, files, consoles, and secrets.
- [x] Monitoring daemon for host metrics, runtime state, and log streaming.
- [x] Internal PKI, ACME SSL, certificate templates, domain tracking, and expiry alerts.
- [x] PostgreSQL and Redis database explorer with encrypted saved credentials.
- [x] Status pages, notifications, audit logs, RBAC, API tokens, OAuth PKCE, and remote MCP access.
- [x] Optional ClickHouse-backed structured logging and optional AI assistant.
- [x] View-based, resource-scoped permission model with filtered list visibility.
- [x] Hardened OIDC/OAuth flows, setup lockout, fail-closed public endpoints, and signed update trust.
- [x] Gateway and daemon update workflows with signature-verified artifacts.
- [x] Settings workspace organized around preferences, gateway configuration, and feature controls.

Planned work:

- [ ] Bastion and SSH management daemon for controlled host access.
- [ ] CLI for scriptable programmatic control from terminals and CI/CD jobs.
- [ ] Plugin system for extending Gateway with new integrations and operational modules.
- [ ] Per-user AI assistant quotas and richer usage reporting.
- [ ] Local username/password authentication as an OIDC alternative.
- [ ] More guided onboarding for first-time installs and first-node setup.
- [ ] Broader operational documentation and examples for common deployment patterns.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Gateway a Kubernetes replacement?</strong></summary>

No. Gateway is for direct infrastructure operations: nginx hosts, Docker hosts, certificates, domains, databases, logs, monitoring, and automation. It can live beside Kubernetes, but it does not try to be a Kubernetes control plane.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do nodes need inbound management ports?</strong></summary>

No. Daemons connect outbound to Gateway over gRPC with mTLS. Nginx nodes still need normal public traffic ports such as `80` and `443` if they serve public sites.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Gateway manage an existing nginx host?</strong></summary>

Yes. Install the nginx daemon in `integrate` mode. Gateway keeps your existing `nginx.conf` and injects managed includes plus a local stats endpoint. See [nginx node modes](docs/nodes.md#nginx-node-modes).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Gateway run without ClickHouse?</strong></summary>

Yes. If `CLICKHOUSE_URL` is empty, the structured logging UI and ingest API are disabled. The rest of Gateway continues to work.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can API or OAuth tokens expose secrets?</strong></summary>

Only when the owning user already has the required scopes. Sensitive OAuth scopes require explicit opt-in during consent, API/OAuth tokens cannot exceed the user's current effective permissions, and resource-scoped write-capable scopes stay bounded to the same resource when they imply read/view checks. See [SCOPES.md](SCOPES.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does Gateway prevent managed nodes from being hijacked?</strong></summary>

Gateway uses its own internal PKI for daemon identity. A node setup command includes a one-time enrollment token and the Gateway gRPC certificate fingerprint. The daemon verifies the presented Gateway TLS leaf certificate before it sends the token, receives an mTLS client certificate from Gateway's node CA, deletes the token from local config, and reconnects with the certificate. Gateway then verifies the certificate identity on control streams, log streams, and renewal requests. See the [security model](docs/security.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if Gateway is offline?</strong></summary>

Managed services keep running. Existing nginx configs continue serving traffic, Docker containers continue running, and daemons reconnect when Gateway returns. Centralized UI/API control is unavailable until the app is back.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the AI assistant required?</strong></summary>

No. It is optional and disabled by default. Gateway does not send data to an AI provider until an admin enables the assistant and configures a provider.
</details>
